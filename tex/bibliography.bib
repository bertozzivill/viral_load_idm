	abstract = {Summary.  The main statistical problem in many epidemiological studies which involve repeated measurements of surrogate markers is the frequent occurrence of missing data. Standard likelihood-based approaches like the linear random-effects model fail to give unbiased estimates when data are non-ignorably missing. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, two markers which have been widely used to track progression of the disease are CD4 cell counts and HIV–ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load levels. Repeated measurements of these markers tend to be informatively censored, which is a special case of non-ignorable missingness. In such cases, we need to apply methods that jointly model the observed data and the missingness process. Despite their high correlation, longitudinal data of these markers have been analysed independently by using mainly random-effects models. Touloumi and co-workers have proposed a model termed the joint multivariate random-effects model which combines a linear random-effects model for the underlying pattern of the marker with a log-normal survival model for the drop-out process. We extend the joint multivariate random-effects model to model simultaneously the CD4 cell and viral load data while adjusting for informative drop-outs due to disease progression or death. Estimates of all the model's parameters are obtained by using the restricted iterative generalized least squares method or a modified version of it using the EM algorithm as a nested algorithm in the case of censored survival data taking also into account non-linearity in the HIV–RNA trend. The method proposed is evaluated and compared with simpler approaches in a simulation study. Finally the method is applied to a subset of the data from the ‘Concerted action on seroconversion to AIDS and death in Europe’ study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in Africa, especially from individuals with well-defined dates of infection. We used data from a prospective cohort study of female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya, who were followed up monthly from before the date of HIV-1 infection.
METHODS: Antiretroviral-naive women who had a well-defined date of HIV-1 infection were included in this analysis. The effects of set point plasma viral load (measured 4-24 months after infection), early CD4+ cell count, and symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection on mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: Among 218 women, the median duration of follow-up after HIV-1 infection was 4.6 years. Forty women died, and at 8.7 years (the time of the last death), the cumulative survival rate was 51\% by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Higher set point viral load, lower early CD4+ cell count, and more-symptomatic acute HIV-1 illness each predicted death. In multivariate analysis, set point viral load (hazard ratio [HR], 2.28 per 1 log10 copies/mL increase; P=.001) and acute HIV-1 illness (HR, 1.14 per each additional symptom; P=.05) were independently associated with higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Among this group of African women, the survival rate was similar to that for HIV-1-infected individuals in industrialized nations before the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy. Higher set point viral load and more-severe acute HIV-1 illness predicted faster progression to death. Early identification of individuals at risk for rapid disease progression may allow closer clinical monitoring, including timely initiation of antiretroviral treatment.},

The authors then applied these models to quantify treatment benefits at the national level in Canada, using back-calculation and forward-projection based on death registries. The study revealed that the lognormal model better describes survival time than the Weibull model. Relative to observations prior to 1987, later observations (in the era of treatment) revealed a statistically significant change in disease progression: the median survival time increased from 10.1 to 12.0 years, but no further survival improvements were observed in the early 1990s. Concurrent with the increase in availability of treatment, the authors have observed pronounced treatment benefits at the national level: prior to 1995, approximately 1,500 deaths were prevented and 4,200 person-years of life were saved. Also, mortality rates were observed to level off in the mid-1990s due to the shape of the historical HIV infection curve and the accumulating availability of treatment in Canada.

	abstract = {The natural course of HIV-1 infection is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in viral load, not just within patients over time, but also between patients, especially during the asymptomatic stage of infection. Asymptomatic, or set-point, viral load has been shown to correlate with both decreased time to AIDS and increased infectiousness. The aim of this study is to characterize the epidemiological impact of heterogeneity in set-point viral load. By analyzing two cohorts of untreated patients, we quantify the relationships between both viral load and infectiousness and the duration of the asymptomatic infectious period. We find that, because both the duration of infection and infectiousness determine the opportunities for the virus to be transmitted, this suggests a trade-off between these contributions to the overall transmission potential. Some public health implications of variation in set-point viral load are discussed. We observe that set-point viral loads are clustered around those that maximize the transmission potential, and this leads us to hypothesize that HIV-1 could have evolved to optimize its transmissibility, a form of adaptation to the human host population. We discuss how this evolutionary hypothesis can be tested, review the evidence available to date, and highlight directions for future research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used data from Europe, North America, and Australia to assess the effect of exposure category on the AIDS incubation period and HIV-1 survival and whether the effect of age at seroconversion varies with exposure category and with time since seroconversion.
METHODS: 38 studies of HIV-1-infected individuals whose dates of seroconversion could be reliably estimated were included in the analysis. Individual data on 13030 HIV-1-infected individuals from 15 countries were collated, checked, and analysed centrally. We calculated estimates of mortality and AIDS incidence rates and estimated the proportions of individuals surviving and developing AIDS at each year after seroconversion from the numbers of observed deaths or cases of AIDS and the corresponding person-years at risk. Analyses were adjusted for age at seroconversion, time since seroconversion, and other factors as appropriate.
FINDINGS: Mortality and AIDS incidence increased strongly with time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion. Median survival varied from 12.5 years (95\% CI 12.1-12.9) for those aged 15-24 years at seroconversion to 7.9 years (7.4-8.5) for those aged 45-54 years at seroconversion, whereas for development of AIDS the corresponding values were 11.0 years (10.7-11.7) and 7.7 years (7.1-8.6). There was no appreciable effect of exposure category on survival. For AIDS incidence, the exposure category effect that we noted was explained by the high incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in those infected through sex between men. We estimated that among people aged 25-29 years at seroconversion 90\% (89-91) and 60\% (57-62) survived to 5 years and 10 years, respectively, after seroconversion, whereas 13\% (12-15) and 46\% (44-49), respectively, developed AIDS (excluding Kaposi's sarcoma).
INTERPRETATION: Before widespread use of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (before 1996), time since seroconversion and age at seroconversion were the major determinants of survival and development of AIDS in Europe, North America, and Australia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate survival patterns after HIV infection in adults in low and middle-income countries.
DESIGN: An analysis of pooled data from eight different studies in six countries.
METHODS: HIV seroconverters were included from eight studies (three population-based, two occupational, and three clinic cohorts) if they were at least 15 years of age, and had no more than 4 years between the last HIV-negative and subsequent HIV-positive test. Four strata were defined: East African cohorts; South African miners cohort; Thai cohorts; Haitian clinic cohort. Kaplan-Meier functions were used to estimate survival patterns, and Weibull distributions were used to model and extend survival estimates. Analyses examined the effect of site, age, and sex on survival.
RESULTS: From 3823 eligible seroconverters, 1079 deaths were observed in 19 671 person-years of follow-up. Survival times varied by age and by study site. Adjusting to age 25-29 years at seroconversion, the median survival was longer in South African miners: 11.6 years [95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.8-13.7] and East African cohorts: 11.1 years (95\% CI 8.7-14.2) than in Haiti: 8.3 years (95\% CI 3.2-21.4) and Thailand: 7.5 years (95\% CI 5.4-10.4). Survival was similar for men and women, after adjustment for age at seroconversion and site.
CONCLUSION: Without antiretroviral therapy, overall survival after HIV infection in African cohorts was similar to survival in high-income countries, with a similar pattern of faster progression at older ages at seroconversion. Survival appears to be significantly worse in Thailand where other, unmeasured factors may affect progression.},

METHODS: Prospective data from 1281 HIV-1-infected patients who started a first protease inhibitor-containing regimen in 1997-1999 were analyzed. Patients with baseline plasma viral load (pVL) {\textgreater} 500 copies per milliliter and at least 2 pVL measures from the eighth month of follow-up were selected. VCY was calculated individually over the follow-up as the area under the pVL curve. Multivariate Cox models analyzed the relation between all-cause mortality and the following variables: age, sex, geographical origin, transmission group, HIV infection duration, ART-naive, pVL at baseline, time-dependent CD4 count, and VCY.
RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-nine patients were followed up for a median of 10 years (interquartile range: 5-11.5). At baseline, median (interquartile range) values for duration of HIV infection, pVL, and CD4 cell count were 43 (4-95) months, 4.6 (3.9-5.2) log10 copies per milliliter, and 278 (125-416) cells per cubic millimeter, respectively. At censoring date, 77 patients (8\%) had died. VCY {\textgreater}1.4 log10 copies × yrs/mL was an independent predictor of death (hazard ratio: 2.0; 95\% confidence interval: 1.2 to 3.5), which was no longer the case after adjustment for the latest pVL value [risk ratio (RR): 1.2 for 1 additional log10 copies per milliliter; 95\% confidence interval: 1.1 to 1.4].
CONCLUSIONS: VCY was associated with mortality in HIV-infected patients under combined antiretroviral therapy but did not overweigh the predictive value of the latest pVL. VCY might be more useful as a marker of persistent viral replication than for routine clinical care.},

UNAIDS has set forth an ambitious 90-90-90 strategy for 2020. Separately, it has been shown theoretically and empirically that HIV virulence can evolve over time. Observed virulence levels may reflect an adaptive balance between infected lifespan and per-contact transmission rate. Critically, the potential effects of widespread ART usage on HIV virulence are unknown. To predict these effects, we used an agent-based stochastic model to simulate changes in HIV virulence, using set point viral load as a virulence proxy. We calibrated our epidemic model to the prevalence and incidence trends of South Africa. We also repeated our analysis using a separate model calibration, as a sensitivity analysis, and found that predicted impact of ART on virulence was relatively insensitive to calibration. We explored two distinct ART scenarios, at increasing coverage levels: ART initiation based on patients reaching a CD4+ T cell count threshold, or based on time elapsed since infection (a scenario that mimics the "universal testing and treatment" aspirations in the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets). We found that HIV virulence is generally unchanged in scenarios of CD4-based initiation. However, with ART initiation based on time since infection (universal test and treat), virulence can increase moderately within several years of ART rollout, under high coverage levels and early treatment initiation albeit within the context of epidemics that are rapidly decreasing in size. We also show that, compared to non-evolutionary HIV epidemic models, allowing for evolving virulence predicts greater declines in HIV incidence after ART rollout. Our modeling study suggests that increasing virulence driven by universal test and treat is likely not a major public health concern, but could be monitored in sentinel surveillance, in a manner similar to transmitted drug resistance.},

	abstract = {CD4 counts and viral loads are dynamic quantities that change with time in HIV-infected persons. Commonly used single summary measures, such as viral load set point or early CD4 count, do not explicitly account for changes in viral load or CD4 counts or other features of the overall time course of these measures. However, the efficient use of all repeated measurements within each subject is often a challenge made more difficult by sparse and irregular sampling over time. Here, we illustrate how functional principal component (FPC) analysis provides an effective statistical approach for exploiting the patterns in CD4 count and viral load data over time. We demonstrate the method by using data from Kenyan women who acquired HIV-1 during follow-up in a cohort that practices high-risk activities and were subsequently followed up prospectively from early infection. The FPC scores for each woman obtained using this method served as informative summary statistics for the CD4 count and viral load trajectories. Similar to baseline CD4 count or viral set point, the first FPC score can be interpreted as a single-value summary measure of an individual's overall CD4 count or viral load. However, unlike most single-value summaries of CD4 count or viral load trajectories, the first FPC score summarizes the dynamics of these quantities and is seen to reveal specific features of the trajectories associated with mortality in this cohort. Moreover, the FPC scores are shown to be a more powerful prognostic factor than other common summaries when used in survival analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The HIV viral load set point has long been used as a prognostic marker of disease progression and more recently as an end-point parameter in HIV vaccine clinical trials. The definition of set point, however, is variable. Moreover, the earliest time at which the set point is reached after the onset of infection has never been clearly defined.
METHODS: In this study, we obtained sequential plasma viral load data from 60 acutely HIV-infected Chinese patients among a cohort of men who have sex with men, mathematically determined viral load set point levels, and estimated time to attain set point after infection. We also compared the results derived from our models and that obtained from an empirical method.
RESULTS: With novel uncomplicated mathematic model, we discovered that set points may vary from 21 to 119 days dependent on the patients' initial viral load trajectory. The viral load set points were 4.28 ± 0.86 and 4.25 ± 0.87 log10 copies per milliliter (P = 0.08), respectively, as determined by our model and an empirical method, suggesting an excellent agreement between the old and new methods.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a novel method to estimate viral load set point at the very early stage of HIV infection. Application of this model can accurately and reliably determine the set point, thus providing a new tool for physicians to better monitor early intervention strategies in acutely infected patients and scientists to rationally design preventative vaccine studies.},

	abstract = {Author Summary
Recent studies have suggested that virulence in HIV-1 is partly a characteristic of the virus which is carried from one infection to the next. An infection with intermediate virulence will produce more transmissions during the infectious lifetime because it optimises the trade-off between rate of transmission and duration of infection. Natural selection acts on the heritable variation to increase the relative prevalence of strains with intermediate virulence. In this study we model the evolution of virulence in the viral population as these more successful strains are preferentially transmitted. We fit this model to data from transmitting couples, and find that the model fits the data well. We use this fit to estimate the contribution of the host and the virus to virulence, which complements recent estimates of the heritability of virulence. We also estimate the rate at which the viral determinants of virulence evolve between infections, and this provides predictions for how rapidly the virulence of HIV-1 evolves in a population. We suggest that natural selection on transmissibility results in substantial evolution of virulence in the population. This is sufficiently rapid for virulence to have reached current levels over the available timescale of the human epidemic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether there are differences between men and women with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the plasma level of viral RNA (the viral load). In men, the initial viral load after seroconversion predicts the likelihood of progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the relation between the two has not been assessed in women. Currently, the guidelines for initiating antiretroviral therapy are applied uniformly to women and men.
METHODS: From 1988 through 1998, the viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count were measured approximately every six months in 156 male and 46 female injection-drug users who were followed prospectively after HIV-1 seroconversion.
RESULTS: The median initial viral load was 50,766 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter in the men but only 15,103 copies per milliliter in the women (P{\textless}0.001). The median initial CD4+ count did not differ significantly according to sex (659 and 672 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively). HIV-1 infection progressed to AIDS in 29 men and 15 women, and the risk of progression did not differ significantly according to sex. For each increase of 1 log in the viral load (on a base 10 scale), the hazard ratio for progression to AIDS was 1.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 2.47) among the men and 1.43 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 2.69) among the women. The median initial viral load was 77,822 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter in the men in whom AIDS developed and 40,634 copies per milliliter in the men in whom it did not; the corresponding values in the women were 17,149 and 12,043 copies per milliliter. Given the recommendation that treatment should be initiated when the viral load reaches 20,000 copies per milliliter, 74 percent of the men but only 37 percent of the women in our study would have been eligible for therapy at the first visit after seroconversion (P{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the initial level of HIV-1 RNA was lower in women than in men, the rates of progression to AIDS were similar. Treatment guidelines that are based on the viral load, rather than the CD4+ lymphocyte count, will lead to differences in eligibility for antiretroviral treatment according to sex.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To address the question of whether individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection have a stable viral load set-point and to assess the influence of host and viral factors on the evolution of viral load in a subset of stable asymptomatic patients with a baseline viral load below 5000 copies/ml and CD4+ T-cell count above 500 x 10(6)/l.
METHODS: Medical visits were performed at least every 6 months including routine blood analysis, viral load and CD4+ T-cell count. HIV-1 RNA was measured in frozen (-70 degrees C) plasma samples using PCR. Patients were classified into three groups according to baseline viral load: group A, {\textless} 200 copies/ml (undetectable); group B, 201-2000 copies/ml; group C, 2001-5000 copies/ml. A survival analysis and a Cox regression model were performed to assess the influence of viral and host factors in the increase of baseline viral load. The endpoint was the time to increase viral load to a stable level {\textgreater} 0.5 log10 copies/ml above baseline viral load in groups B and C and to a stable detectable viral load ({\textgreater} 200 copies/ml) in group A.
RESULTS: A cohort of 114 patients with viral load below 5000 copies/ml was followed for a median of 12 months (6-42 months). Overall, 22 (19\%) out of 114 patients had an increase {\textgreater} 0.5 log10 copies/ml of baseline viral load. Baseline viral load increased in two (5\%) out of 37 patients in group A, four (12\%) out of 33 patients in group B, and 16 (36\%) out of 44 patients in group C (survival analysis, P{\textless}0.002). Patients of group C had a eightfold higher risk of increasing baseline viral load than patients in the other two groups pooled together (hazards ratio, 8.28; 95\% confidence interval, 1.78-38; P = 0.006). Patients with an increase of viral load to the virological endpoint had a threefold higher risk of decreasing baseline CD4+ T-cell counts {\textgreater} 100 x 10(6)/I than patients with stable viral load (hazards ratio, 2.78; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12-14; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of chronically HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patients with a baseline viral load {\textless} 5000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count {\textgreater} 500 x 10(6)/l, a true viral load set-point did not seem to exist. Patients with baseline viral load of 2000-5000 copies/ml had an eightfold higher risk of increasing the level of viral load than patients with a baseline viral load below 2000 copies/ml.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: HIV-1 RNA levels in peripheral blood are strongly associated with progression to AIDS, CD4+ T-cell decline, or death. Their predictive value is reportedly independent of the predictive value of CD4+ T-cell counts. Because the interrelations between these parameters of HIV-1 infection are poorly understood, we studied the kinetics and predictive value of serum HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell counts, and T-cell function.
DESIGN AND METHODS: HIV RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell counts, and T-cell function were measured from seroconversion to AIDS in 123 homosexual men who seroconverted during a prospective study and were followed over 10 years.
RESULTS: Two patterns of median HIV-1 RNA levels were found during infection: a steady-state and a 'U-shaped' curve. Steady-state high RNA levels were related to rapid disease progression. For the U-shaped curve, there were groups with high and low RNA levels related to disease progression. At 1 year after seroconversion, RNA level was the only marker that was strongly predictive. Furthermore, decreasing RNA levels in the first year following seroconversion were related to better prognosis than stable low levels. Low CD4+ T-cell count and T-cell function became predictive of progression to AIDS at 2 and 5 years after seroconversion, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: With ongoing infection, the predictive value of low CD4+ T-cell count and T-cell function increases, whereas the predictive value of high HIV-1 RNA level decreases. These findings reflect the observation that infection with HIV progressively leads towards immune deficiency, which in later stages is most predictive of disease progression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: the number and proportion of adults diagnosed with HIV infection aged 50 years and older has risen. This study compares the effect of CD4 counts and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) on mortality rates among adults diagnosed aged ≥50 with those diagnosed at a younger age.
METHODS: retrospective cohort analysis of national surveillance reports of HIV-diagnosed adults (15 years and older) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The relative impacts of age, CD4 count at diagnosis and ART on mortality were determined in Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: among 63,805 adults diagnosed with HIV between 2000 and 2009, 9\% (5,683) were aged ≥50 years; older persons were more likely to be white, heterosexual and present with a CD4 count {\textless}200 cells/mm(3) (48 versus 32\% P {\textless} 0.01) and AIDS at diagnosis (19 versus 9\%, P {\textless} 0.01). One-year mortality was higher in older adults (10 versus 3\%, P {\textless} 0.01) and especially in those diagnosed with a CD4 {\textless}200 cells/mm(3) left untreated (46 versus 15\%, P {\textless} 0.01). While the relative mortality risk reduction from ART initiation at CD {\textless}200 cells/mm(3) was similar in both age groups, the absolute risk difference was higher among older adults (40 versus 12\% fewer deaths) such that the number needed to treat older adults to prevent one death was two compared with eight among younger adults.
CONCLUSIONS: the magnitude of benefit from ART is greater in older adults than younger adults. Older persons should be considered as a target for HIV testing. Coupled with prompt treatment, earlier diagnosis is likely to reduce substantially deaths in this group.},

METHODS: Patients from the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) and the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) were included in the analysis. We used survival methods to assess the association between older age and all-cause mortality, as well as time to treatment modification. We used regression analyses to evaluate changes in CD4 counts after combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation and determined the odds of detectable viral load, up to 24 months of treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 7142 patients were included in these analyses (60\% in TAHOD and 40\% in AHOD), of whom 25\% were {\textgreater}50 years old. In multivariable analyses, those aged {\textgreater} 50 years were at least twice as likely to die as those aged 30-39 years [hazard ratio (HR) for 50-59 years: 2.27; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-3.83; HR for {\textgreater} 60 years: 4.28; 95\% CI 2.42-7.55]. The effect of older age on CD4 count changes was insignificant (p-trend=0.06). The odds of detectable viral load after cART initiation decreased with age (p-trend={\textless} 0.0001). The effect of older age on time to first treatment modification was insignificant (p-trend=0.21). We found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between AHOD and TAHOD participants for all endpoints examined.
CONCLUSIONS: The associations between older age and typical patient outcomes in HIV-positive patients from the Asia Pacific region are similar in AHOD and TAHOD.

We compare the accuracy of the VACS and restricted indices (1) among subjects outside the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, (2) more than 1-5 years of prior exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and (3) within important patient subgroups.
METHODS: We used data from 13 cohorts in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration (n = 10, 835) limiting analyses to HIV-infected subjects with at least 12 months exposure to ART. Variables included demographic, laboratory (CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate and alanine transaminase, creatinine, and hepatitis C status), and survival. We used C-statistics and net reclassification improvement (NRI) to test discrimination varying prior ART exposure from 1 to 5 years. We then combined Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (n = 5066) and North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration data, fit a parametric survival model, and compared predicted to observed mortality by cohort, gender, age, race, and HIV-1 RNA level.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 3.3 years (655 deaths). Compared with the restricted index, the VACS index showed greater discrimination (C-statistics: 0.77 vs. 0.74; NRI: 12\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). NRI was highest among those with HIV-1 RNA {\textless}500 copies per milliliter (25\%) and age ≥50 years (20\%). Predictions were similar to observed mortality among all subgroups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of HIV-infection among individuals ≥ 50 years of age has increased, the impact of HIV-infection on risk of death in this population remains to be established. Our aim was to estimate long-term mortality among HIV-infected individuals who were 50 years or older, when compared with an individually-matched cohort from the background population.
METHODS: Population-based cohort-study including HIV-infected individuals ≥ 50 years, who were alive 1 year after HIV-diagnosis (n = 2440) and a comparison cohort individually-matched by age and gender extracted from the background population (n = 14,588). Cumulative survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Mortality Rate Ratios (MRRs) were estimated using Cox Regression Models. Study period 1996-2014.
RESULTS: Estimated median survival time from age 50 years for HIV-infected individuals increased from 11.8 years (95\% CI: 10.2 to 14.5) during 1996-1999 to 22.8 years (20.0-24.2) in 2006-2014. MRR decreased with increasing age from 3.8 (3.1-4.7) for 50-55 years to 1.6 (1.0-2.6) for 75-80 years. In a cohort of well-treated HIV-infected individuals ≥ 50 years without AIDS-defining events or comorbidity at study inclusion (n = 517). MRR was 1.7 (1.2-2.3) compared with population controls without comorbidity.
CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected individuals estimated median survival time from age 50 years has increased by more than 10 years from 1996-1999 to 2006-2014, but is still substantially lower than in the background population. Even among well-treated HIV-infected individuals ≥ 50 years without comorbidity or AIDS-defining events the estimated median survival time remains lower than in the general population.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to better understand the prognostic factors influencing the disease progression and mortality in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a high-middle-income country. This registry-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Tehran from April 2004 to March 2014. We enrolled 2473 HIV-infected patients who had a medical record in Behavioral Diseases Counseling Centers. The outcomes of interest were the estimation of time: (1) from HIV diagnosis to AIDS progression and (2) from AIDS to AIDS-related death. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year probability of disease progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS was 45.0\%, 69.9\%, and 90.4\%, and that of AIDS-related death was 17.2\%, 30.3\%, and 39.2\%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that AIDS progression was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.022), an increase in age (P = 0.001), low educational levels (P = 0.001), and a decreased level of CD4 cell count (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the AIDS-related mortality was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.010), tuberculosis coinfection (P = 0.001), and antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.001). The results of this study indicated that progression to AIDS and AIDS-related death is affected by several modifiable and non-modifiable predictors. We indicated that a substantial proportion of the HIV-positive people were unaware of their status and were diagnosed very late. This hidden source of HIV infection had the opportunity to transmit the infection to other people.},

	abstract = {Twenty-five years after the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS there is still no effective vaccine and no cure for this disease. HIV susceptibility shows a substantial degree of individual heterogeneity, much of which can be conferred by host genetic variation. In an effort to discover host factors required for HIV replication, identify crucial pathogenic pathways, and reveal the full armament of host defenses, there has been a shift from candidate-gene studies to unbiased genome-wide genetic and functional studies. However, the number of securely identified host factors involved in HIV disease remains small, explaining only approximately 15-20\% of the observed heterogeneity - most of which is attributable to human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) variants. Multidisciplinary approaches integrating genetic epidemiology to systems biology will be required to fully understand virus-host interactions to effectively combat HIV/AIDS.},

	abstract = {To characterize the clinical, virological, and immunological status at presentation as well as the outcome of patients diagnosed with HIV above the age of 50., A retrospective study of 418 patients newly diagnosed with HIV in 1 Israeli center, between the years 2004 and 2013., Patients with new HIV diagnosis ≥50 years of age defined as “older" and {\textless}50 defined as “younger." Patients were evaluated every 1 to 3 months (mean follow-up 53 ± 33 months). Patients with {\textless}2 CD4/viral-load measurements or with {\textless}1 year of follow-up were excluded. Time of HIV infection was estimated by HIV sequence ambiguity assay. Ambiguity index ≤0.43 indicated recent (≤1 year) HIV infection., Eighty nine (21\%) patients were diagnosed with HIV at an older age. Those older patients presented with significant lower CD4 cell counts and higher viral-load compared with the younger patients. At the end of the study, the older patients had higher mortality rate (21\% vs 3.5\%; P {\textless} 0.001) and lower CD4 cell counts (381 ± 228 vs 483 ± 261cells/μL; P {\textless} 0.001) compared with the younger patients. This difference was also observed between older and younger patients with similar CD4 cell counts and viral load at the time of HIV diagnosis and among patients with a recent (≤1 year) HIV infection., One-fifth of HIV patients are diagnosed at older age (≥50 years). Those older patients have less favorable outcome compared with the younger patients. This point to the need of educational and screening programs within older populations and for a closer follow-up of older HIV patients.},

	abstract = {Viral load fluctuates during the natural course of asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. It is often assumed that these fluctuations are random around a set point or underlying growth trend. Using longitudinal data, we tested whether fluctuations in viral load can be better explained by changes in CD4+ T-cell count than by a set point or trend of exponential growth. The correspondence between viral load and CD4+ T-cell count could be described by a simple mathematical relation. Using a bootstrapping approach, the hypothesis that viral load fluctuations are random around a set point was rejected with p {\textless} .00005. The hypothesis that viral load fluctuations are random around a trend of exponential growth was rejected with p {\textless} .005. Viral load data was explained better by changes in CD4+ T-cell counts than by a set point or by a trend of exponential growth. The implications of this finding for improved prognostication are discussed.},
